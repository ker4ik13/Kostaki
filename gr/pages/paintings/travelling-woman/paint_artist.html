					(VKHUTEMAS) and was a member of the Institute of Artistic Culture
					(INKHUK). She was one of the creators of the new system of practical
					artistic construction. She also participated in the “5 x 5 = 25”

					Print Factory in Moscow. She also executed designs for book and
					magazine covers, posters and porcelain. These artworks were presented
