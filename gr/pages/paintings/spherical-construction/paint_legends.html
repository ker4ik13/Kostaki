							Kliun officially declared himself an artist only at the age of 35.
							He was an accountant by profession. For 10 years he combined these
							very different types of activities. For his incorruptibility, he
							was entrusted with solving financial issues at artistic
							enterprises.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Immediately after graduation, Kliun got a job as an assistant
							accountant at a sugar factory, where he attracted the attention of
							the cashier’s niece. When her parents invited him to marry her,
							the future artist fled to Poland. He explained his action by the
							desire “for higher interests.” Kliun married in 1902, when he was
							already in Moscow, to Ekaterina Konstantinovna Slepneva and they
							had three children. Two of the most emblematic works of Kliun’s
							early period: "The Artist's Wife" (1910) and "The Family" (1911)
							are part of the Costakis collection. Both works share the
							distinctive image of the artist’s wife in a leaning position. She
							was a woman of frail health, and Kliun tried to banish this
							reality through the force of painting.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							Kliun’s meeting with Malevich led to friendship and joint creative
							and theoretical research. Kliun was in Malevich’s shadow for a
							very long time considered to be a “minor” artist. However, having
							studied Kliun’s legacy, art historians recognized his leading role
							in this creative tandem.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							In 1918, Kliun decided to move away from Suprematism, calling it a
							corpse “with a fixed, dead gaze.” In response to criticism from
							Malevich, who saw “lyricism and even romance” in his works, Kliun
							wrote: “if painting died, pressed down with the Black Square, then
							the colors did not die.”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Kliun's ideas, embedded in his spherical compositions, were later
							embodied in the works of representatives of American abstract
							impressionism, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. And the hanging
							sculptures - structures floating in the air made of various
							geometric shapes - anticipated the mobiles of Alexander Calder.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							During the Stalinist period, when avant-garde was prohibited and
							there started a war against formalism, Kliun was accused of
							formalism. It was Kliun and his composition “Suprematism” that
							became the heroes of a cartoon on this topic in the satirical
							Soviet magazine “Crocodile”. During the period of fight against
							formalism, being excluded from all artistic associations, in order
							to feed his family, Kliun painted movie posters, flower posters
							for the Green Space Trust and illustrations for the book “Defects
							of Wood” for the Forestry Institute.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In 2019, the painting “Spherical Suprematism” was sold at
							Sotheby’s for $6.3 million.
