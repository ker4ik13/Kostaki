					At first, I managed to get two paintings by Lyubov Popova, then the
					thread broke, and it was only by chance that I got back on the right
					track.

					Popova died in 1924, after which I met her brother Pavel Sergeievich
					Popov, a university professor, a very handsome, tall gentleman. He
					lived on the Arbat street, in one of the alleys, in a large apartment.
					In the room where he received me, I saw two small paintings by Popova.

				<p>
					I said that I had heard a lot about his sister. He answered: “Yes, you
					know, she died early, but I still have some of her works”. I said I
					was collecting her works and wanted to buy them from him. And he
					replied: ”Why not? I’ll show you”. He led me into another room, where
					10-15 canvases were stacked. All first-class! And I bought them.

				<p>
					Pavel Sergeievich parted with small canvases with great difficulty.
					When I told him that I wanted to buy a small one too, he did not
					agree: “I will leave this one, because it is small, you can always
					hang it, but the big ones... What shall I do with them?”

				<p>
					Pavel Sergeievich had a stepson who lived in Zvenigorod. Pavel
					Sergeievich once suggested me to visit him because he assumed that
					some paintings of his sister might have remained there. So I went …

				<p>
					Country house, large garden. It was just the time of flowering — pink
					and white apple trees, cherries. I was welcomed very friendly.
				</p>
				<img
					src="../../../../images/comics/Kostakis07-Q.webp"
					alt="Image"

				<p>
					And the first thing I saw when I climbed the stairs to the second
					floor was Popova’s painting - there was a craft hanging on it...
				</p>

				<p>
					Then we walked around the garden. And I saw the window of the barn,
					nailed with a plywood. The signature could be read on the plywood:
					“Popova”.
				</p>

				<p>
					I went into the barn and saw that on the back of the plywood there was
					a beautiful work by the artist. I immediately offered to sell it to
					me, but the owner of the house replied: “No, I can’t, if it rains,
					everything in the barn will get wet. First, bring me the plywood, and
					then I’ll give you the painting”.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had to go to Moscow to look for plywood. I didn’t find the right
					piece, so I bought two smaller ones and brought them to Zvenigorod.

					In exchange, the owner gave me the wonderful painting. He also sold
					the rest of the paintings to me very cheaply.

					Thus, I acquired most of Popova’s works from the family of the artist.
