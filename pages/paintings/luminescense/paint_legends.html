							A student of Malevich and Pevzner in the Moscow free workshops,
							Kudriashov was a leading representative of pictorial “cosmism”.
						</p>

							His father manufactured aeronautical devices in the bureau of the
							scientist and designer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Kudriashov helped
							his father with drawings and models and eventually became
							interested in the ideas of intergalactic light-air prophecy
							(cosmism). It can be said that he was the predecessor of James
							Turrell and Olafur Eliasson.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							One of his key works is the general scheme of painting of the 1st
							Soviet theater auditorium in Orenburg. This is an example of how
							non-objective painting can be combined with real space. Standing
							in front of the painting with a scjeme, the viewer should imagine
							that he is lying on the floor of an ancient multi-tiered theater,
							and then the imaginary arches will turn out to be a painting of
							tiers, the floor will be a Suprematist curtain, and the red square
							in the center will be a lampshade.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							At the end of the 1920s, Kudriashov’s ideas were no longer in
							demand. The artist was expelled from all artistic associations for
							“formalism and persistent pointlessness,” but he could not change
							his principles and preferred to be poor, but not a socialist
							realist. During this period, he took on any work, for 2 years he
							was even a prison guard - he was in charge of a storage room
							belongings of a prison.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Kudriashov anticipated Gagarin's flight. Since 1957, he had again
							turned to the space theme. Inspired by news of the cosmonaut dogs
							Belka and Strelka, Kudriashov creates a watercolor of a
							Suprematist cosmonaut stretching his arms in interstellar space.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							For Kudriashov’s personal exhibition at the Jean Chauvelin gallery
							in Paris in 1970, works were smuggled out of Russia.
