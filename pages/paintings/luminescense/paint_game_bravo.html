          Correct!
          <br />
          In the late 1910s, Aleksei Kudriashov, model maker and father of the
          artist Ivan Kudriashov, a student – later – of Kazimir Malevich,
          visited the Russian city of Kaluga several times to help engineer
          Konstantin Tsiolkovskii make his space rocket models. The young, then,
          Ivan Kudriasov accompanied his father on these visits and actually
          helped to create spaceship miniatures, based on Tsiolkovskii's
          technical drawings. Visits to Tsiolkovskii's workshop made such a
          strong impression on Ivan Kudriashov that he was inspired and
          developed the concept of "Cosmism", a way of "space painting". His
          work "Luminescence” intends to show remnants of a flight path, or at
          least traces of its flare energy, even if it has already begun to
          curve along the inclined trajectory of interplanetary space travel.

          Let's experiment, what if other artists were also fascinated by the
          theme of space? Choose a quote from Tsiolkovsky and an artist, and
          Artificial Intelligence will generate paintings for us!
