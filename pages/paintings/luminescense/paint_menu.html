					In the late 1910s, Aleksei Kudriashov, model maker and father of the
					artist Ivan Kudriashov, a student – later – of Kazimir Malevich,
					visited the Russian city of Kaluga several times to help engineer
					Konstantin Tsiolkovskii make his space rocket models. The young, then,
					Ivan Kudriasov accompanied his father on these visits and actually
					helped to create spaceship miniatures, based on Tsiolkovskii's
					technical drawings. Visits to Tsiolkovskii's workshop made such a
					strong impression on Ivan Kudriashov that he was inspired and
					developed the concept of "Cosmism", a way of "space painting". His
					work "Luminescence” intends to show remnants of a flight path, or at
					least traces of its flare energy, even if it has already begun to
					curve along the inclined trajectory of interplanetary space travel.
