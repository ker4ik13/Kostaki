					Association of Artists”, where he met Malevich and Kliun. During the
					years 1909-1910 he traveled around Europe (Germany, Austria, Italy,
					France) and became familiar with the work of Monet, Courbet, and

					During the years 1913-1914 he worked with Malevich to develop
					“alogism-pro-dadaism” in painting. His works were presented at the
					First Futurist Exhibition of Paintings: Tramway V (Petrograd, 1915)
					and at the exhibition The Store (Moscow, 1916). From 1918 up to 1920
