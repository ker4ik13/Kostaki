							Alexey Morgunov was the son of the famous landscape painter and
							wanderer Alexei Savrasov, from whom he inherited his talent.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							After traveling around Europe, Morgunov opened his own studio,
							known as “Morgunovka”. It became a meeting place for leftist
							painters and a “free academy” for painters.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Perhaps it was Morgunov, and not Malevich, who became the
							discoverer of pointlessness. The idea of borrowing is suggested by
							his “Composition No. 1” with the dominance of a red square in the
							center.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Malevich called Morgunov his colleague in Februaryism. The
							Februaryists declared themselves using irrational methods,
							gestures, and actions. The Moscow public remembered them for their
							“parade of futurists” on the Kuznetsky Bridge on March 1, 1914. On
							this day, Morgunov and Malevich walked through the favorite
							walking place of the bourgeois public in Moscow in jackets with
							red wooden spoons in their buttonholes. With this action they
							wanted to shock the public and achieved their goal, hitting the
							headlines that day.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Another shocking act of the Februaryists was their speech at the
							discussion of the exhibition of the “Jack of Diamonds” - an
							artistic association of the early avant-garde. Morgunov, who
							disagreed with the criticism of his work, called its author (art
							critic Tugenhold) a “fool,” for which he was deprived of the word
							and removed from the audience, and subsequently expelled from the
							association. But he received the support of Malevich, who liked
							the trick.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the last decade of his creative career, Morgunov completely
							moved away from the avant-garde and created thematic paintings in
							the spirit of socialist realism. He glorified the hard labor on
							construction sites and the life of collective farmers in a
							post-impressionist, neo-primitivist and realistic manner.
