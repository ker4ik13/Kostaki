							Aleksey Morgunov was the son of the famous landscape painter and
							wanderer Aleksei Savrasov, from whom he inherited his talent.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							After traveling around Europe, Morgunov opened his own studio,
							known as “Morgunovka”. It became a meeting place for leftist
							painters and a “free academy” for painters.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Perhaps it was Morgunov, and not Malevich, who became the
							discoverer of Non-objectivity. The idea is suggested by his
							“Composition No. 1” with the dominance of a red square in the
							center.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Malevich called his colleague Morgunov to participate in
							Februaryism. The Februaryists were a group of artists that used
							irrational methods, gestures, and actions. The Moscow public
							remembered them for their “parade of futurists” on the Kuznetsky
							Bridge on March 1, 1914. On this day, Morgunov and Malevich walked
							through the favorite walking place of the bourgeois public in
							Moscow wearing jackets with red wooden spoons in their
							buttonholes. With this action they wanted to shock the public and
							achieved their goal, hitting the headlines that day.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Another shocking act of the Februaryists was their speech during
							the discussion of the exhibition of the “Jack of Diamonds” - an
							artistic association of the early avant-garde. Morgunov, who
							disagreed with the criticism of his work, called its author (the
							art critic Tugenhold) a “fool,” for which he was not given the
							opportunity to speak in front of the audience and was even asked
							to leave the exhibition. And in a while expelled from the
							association. But he received the support of Malevich, who liked
							the trick.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the last decade of his creative career, Morgunov completely
							moved away from the avant-garde and created thematic paintings in
							the spirit of socialist realism. He glorified the hard labor on
							construction sites and the life of collective farmers in a
							post-impressionist, neo-primitivist and realistic manner.
