					The Futurist poets and painters in Russia professed that a sweeping
					subversion of the world as we know it is necessary in order to open
					the way to a brighter future. They believed that the abolition of old
					values and axiomatic principles will enable humanity to revisit its
					relation with the universe and with nature, and consequently to obtain
					limitless potential. When the world has turned into chaos, they would
					assert in 1913, “new, unexpected and invisible connections” will be
					revealed. Their model of the man of the future - the Futurist hero -
					was the aviator, the man who succeeded in overcoming nature’s
					limitations and achieve the ultimate freedom by flying in the air.
					Aleksei Morgunov’s “Standing Figure (Aviator)” belongs to this series
					of visual and literary avant-garde works of art, which support the
					Futurist belief that after a historic reorganization of the order of
					the world, humanity will emerge stronger.
