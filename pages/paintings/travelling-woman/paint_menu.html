					The work (entitled Traveling Woman from the Costakis collection at
					MOMus-Museum of Modern Art in Thessaloniki) is of great interest
					because one can see that it is a completely synthetic work that
					encompasses details, elements and experimental forms of all other
					Popova's works of her final cubofuturistic period.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Fine lines, straight and broken, triangles, squares, and arcs, and
					semicircles, despite the apparent chaotic construction, form a unified
					and harmonious composition.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Multiple parallel and intersecting facets and planes, superimposed on
					each other, do not hinder the recognition of individual objects. In
					the painting, one can easily distinguish letters forming words, faces,
					cylinders, waves, and various other images.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The painting creates the impression of dynamic movement in time and
					space, as if the objects depicted on it are constantly moving or
					swaying, ready to fly off the canvas.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Scattered figures create a sense of relief, which is enhanced by the
					plasticity of each drawn line.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The work is painted in a restrained style, characteristic of all
					cubists. In this piece, the artist possibly attempted to convey
					impressions of her travels within the country and abroad through
					individual images, silhouettes, letter combinations. According to
					another version, the artist tried to convey impressions of the travels
					of her friend Adelaida Dege.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The painting Travelling Woman and several other works from this period
					are associated with Popovaâ€™s transition to cubo-futurism and
					non-representational art.
