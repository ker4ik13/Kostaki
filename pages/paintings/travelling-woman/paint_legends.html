							Liubov Popova also participated with a great number of works at
							the “0,10, Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings” including her
							painting titled Travelling Woman, the most “expensive” painting in
							this exhibition, according to the sale prices written by hand on a
							copy of the catalogue by Ivan Puni. Researchers studying Popova’s
							work are familiar with the confusion surrounding the identity of
							her work titled Travelling Woman, which was artwork no. 92 in the
							“0,10” exhibition catalogue and was later also presented in Moscow
							at the Store exhibition (1916) and at the 5th State Exhibition
							(1918-19). The Costakis collection at MOMus-Museum of Modern Art
							in Thessaloniki includes the well-known large painting (oil on
							canvas, 158.5 Χ 123 cm) under the above title, which is also the
							title of the painting in the Norton Simon Museum’s collection in
							Los Angeles (known as Traveller and also deriving from the
							Costakis collection).

							The distinguished scholar of the Russian avant-garde Anatoli
							Strigalev claimed that the work that was presented at the 0,10
							exhibition under the title Travelling Woman was the painting in
							the Norton Simon Museum’s collection, since it depicts – with
							greater clarity – a female figure sitting in a train compartment
							holding an umbrella. Anatoli Strigalev had proposed a new title
							for the artwork in the Costakis collection in Thessaloniki, namely
							Travelling Man, because there are elements in the painting
							pointing to a male and not female figure (e.g. tail coat, hat).
							However, there are elements of a female figure in this painting as
							well, such as the asymmetric oval contour that is repeated
							horizontally as a white volume in the left central section of the
							painting. On the back of the canvas it is written in marker, which
							means that it could not be written before 1950, the Russian title
							'Puteshesvennitsa' (Travelling Woman).

							All assumptions aside, there is an interesting element that
							provides a final solution to the issue of the two Travelling
							Women. In the catalogue of Popova’s posthumous exhibition, which
							was held in Moscow in 1924, the painting is presented under the
							title “Travelling Woman (version 2)”. In the original photographs
							of that exhibition saved by Costakis, one clearly sees the artwork
							that is today part of the Norton Simon collection hanging on the
							wall. Therefore we can assume that the painting in the Norton
							Simon collection is ‘version Νο 2’ of the Travelling Woman, while
							the painting of the same name at MOMus is version No.1
