					Liubov Sergeevna Popova (Ivanovskoe near Moscow, April 24th, 1889-
					Moscow, May 25th, 1924) studied at the private studios of Stanislav
					Zhukovskii, Ivan Dudin and Konstantin Yuon in Moscow from 1907 to
					1908. In the years 1909-1912 she traveled to Kiev, to ancient Russian
					cities and Italy. She was particularly impressed by the works of
					Mikhail Vrubel, Giotto as well as by the old Russian Art and
					architecture.

					In 1912 she worked with Tatlin in his studio, in Moscow, known as “The
					Tower”. In the winter of 1912 she moved to Paris and worked in the
					Academie La Palette, under Henri Le Fauconnier and Jean Metzinger,
					with Vera Pestel, Nadezhda Udaltsova and other Russian artists. She
					returned to Moscow in 1913. In January- February 1914 she exhibited
					with the “Jack of Diamonds” group and in the spring of 1914 she
					traveled to France and Italy with Ida Burmeister and Vera Mukhina.

					In 1915-1916 she made a transition to a non-representational style, to
					which she applied the forms of Russian icon painting and ancient
					oriental architecture. She participated in the exhibition The First
					Futurist Exhibition of Paintings: Tramway V (Petrograd, 1915) and in
					the Jack of Diamonds (Moscow, 1916).

					In 1916-1917 she was an active member of the group “Supremus” and
					produced designs for the Verbovka’s Company in the Ukraine. She
					participated from 1918 to 1920 in various exhibitions, including the
					Tenth State Exhibition: Non-objective Creation and Suprematism in
					Moscow. In November 1918 she returned to Moscow. From 1920 onwards she
					taught at the Higher State Art-Technical Studios (VKHUTEMAS) and was a
					member of the Institute of Artistic Culture (INKHUK). She was one of
					the creators of the new system of practical artistic construction. She
					also participated in the 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition of 1921 in Moscow.

				<br />

					During 1922-1923 she designed the stage sets for Vselovod Meierkhold’s
					productions of Fernard Kromenlick’s The Magnanimus Cuckold and Sergei
					Tretiakov’s Earth in Turmoil. In 1924 she started designing textiles
					for the First State Textile Print Factory in Moscow. She also executed
					designs for book and magazine covers, posters and porcelain. These
					artworks were presented at her posthumous exhibition, which traveled
					from Moscow (1924) to Kiev (1925) and to Krasnodar (1926).
