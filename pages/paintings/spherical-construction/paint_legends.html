					Kliun officially became an artist only at the age of 35. He was an
					accountant by profession. For 10 years he combined these very
					different types of activities. For his incorruptibility, he was
					entrusted with solving financial issues at artistic enterprises.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Immediately after graduation, Kliun got a job as an assistant
					accountant at a sugar factory, where he attracted the attention of the
					cashier’s niece. When her parents invited him to marry her, the future
					artist fled to Poland. He explained his action by the desire “for
					higher interests.” Kliun still married, but much later, already in
					Moscow.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Kliun’s meeting with Malevich led to friendship and joint creative and
					theoretical research. Kliun was in Malevich’es shadow for a very long
					time as a “minor” artist. However, having studied Kliun’s legacy, art
					historians recognized his leading role in this creative tandem.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1918, however, their friendship ended. Kliun decided to move away
					from Suprematism, calling it a corpse “with a fixed, dead gaze.” In
					response to criticism from Malevich, who saw “lyricism and even
					romance” in his works, Kliun wrote: “if painting died, pressed down
					with the Black Square, then the colors did not die.”
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Kliun's ideas, embedded in his spherical compositions, were later
					embodied in the works of representatives of American abstract
					impressionism, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. And the hanging
					sculptures - structures floating in the air made of various geometric
					shapes - anticipated the mobiles of Alexander Calder.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Like most avant-garde artists in the 30s, Kliun was accused of
					formalism. It was Kliun and his composition “Suprematism” that became
					the heroes of a cartoon on this topic in the satirical Soviet magazine
					“Crocodile”. During the period of fight against formalism, being
					excluded from all artistic associations, in order to feed his family,
					Kliun painted movie posters, flower posters for the Green Space Trust
					and illustrations for the book “Defects of Wood” for the Forestry
					Institute.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 2019, the painting “Spherical Suprematism” was sold at Sothby’s for
					$6.3 million.
