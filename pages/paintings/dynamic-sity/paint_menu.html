					From 1919 to 1921 Gustav Klucis was working on the idea of the painted
					representation of a planet floating through space, a planet on which
					the rules of atmospheric gravity are observed while the various
					minimalist planes intersecting the sphere seek to convey messages
					relating to the possibilities of new technological advances.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The central painting, of particular interest in terms of the use of
					materials which transform the texture, is titled “Dynamic City”.
					Klucis also presented the painting under the title “Plan for the City
					of the Future”, and described his artistic method as “axonometric
					painting”. The work also reflects the fascination felt by many of the
					Russian avant-garde artists for theories of cosmic, astronomical
					phenomena, and their interest in the future conquest of space, the
					study of the universe and the habitation of planets. Klucis continued
					working for several years on this motif of the “Dynamic City” and made
					a series of photomontage images, which capture a futuristic
					representation of a modern city with facades of skyscrapers and obtain
					a selectively representational character with elements of human
					figures and walls of buildings projected from all points and thus
					creating a sense of gravity, as it happens on a planet.
