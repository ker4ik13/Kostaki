							In the 1920s the political posters of Klucis’s wife, Valentina
							Kulagina, were a good deal more popular and in greater demand than
							his own works.

							In 1928 Klucis created a series of postcards dedicated to the
							Spartakiada All-Union Sports and Athletic Contest. These postcards
							are considered to be the most expensive soviet postcards in the
							world. A full set of 9 pieces is deemed to be an absolute rarity.

							“Look from all sides”—Klucis pursued this goal when creating
							color-tone and planar-spatial structures that visually acquired
							three-dimensional volume and dynamics. The master dedicated a
							series of images of the so-called “dynamic city” to the theme of
							dynamic structure. Some of the compositions allow the top and
							bottom to change arbitrarily, and the visual field to rotate. The
							dynamics in these works are enhanced by diagonal linear
							constructions and rhythmically repeated elements.
