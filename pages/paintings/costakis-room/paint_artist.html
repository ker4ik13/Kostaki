					You have entered the museum, which presents the collection of George
					Costakis. George did not have any special art education; he was a
					self-taught enthusiast endowed with curiosity and taste, carrying an
					unquenchable thirst for beauty in his soul. His fascination with art
					led Costakis to start collecting paintings, graphics, icons, becoming
					a world-renowned collector, the possessor of a unique collection of
					Russian avant-garde works and Soviet artists from the early 20th
					century.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Costakis was not a rich man; he did not possess a fortune worth
					millions. The only source for purchasing artworks was the money he
					earned himself.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					When George collected works of the Russian avant-garde, merely
					mentioning the names of avant-garde artists could put someone at risk
					of repression. Provincial museums were not allowed to show the
					avant-garde works in their halls. In some cases they were even written
					off their store rooms. But Costakis took the risk—being the first in
					the Soviet Union to comprehend the significance of Russian avant-garde
					in the history of world art, seeking and collecting drawings,
					canvases, porcelain and archives. He preserved much that, left to the
					whims of fate, would have vanished into obscurity.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					George Costakis was born in 1913 in Russia in a large family: he had
					three brothers and a sister. Remaining a Greek citizen, he spent most
					of his life in Russia.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					His older brother, Spiridon Costakis, worked as a chauffeur but was
					not just any chauffeur; he was a top-class racer. For several years,
					he won the country's motorcycle championships, which were quite
					popular at the time. Naturally, the brother was an idol for George.
					During those years, the profession of a chauffeur was highly
					prestigious. Many young men from intellectual families, sometimes with
					higher education, proud of their driving skills, held it in high
					regard. Thus, George began working as a driver at the Greek Embassy
					after school.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					While working as a driver, George often drove the ambassador to
					consignment shops. These visits marked his initial exposure to the
					world of beauty, offering an opportunity to broaden horizons and
					develop a taste. George spent a long time among collectors, listened
					to what they said, observed what they purchased. Gradually, he learned
					to discern and began acquiring porcelain, then mainly Dutch paintings,
					followed by Russian silver, carpets, and fabrics. This continued for
					about ten years.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					During the War the Greek Embassy moved from Moscow and George Costakis
					found a job at the Canadian Embassy, where he worked until he retired.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					But George always pondered that if he continued in the same manner, he
					wouldn't bring anything new to the art world. Everything he collected
					already existed in every major museum in any country and in private
					collections as well. Continuing in the same direction, he could become
					wealthy, but... not much more. He yearned to do something
					extraordinary. Quite accidentally, he found himself in a Moscow
					apartment. There, for the first time, he saw two or three canvases by
					avant-garde artists, one of them by Olga Rozanova... And so, he
					purchased the painting by Rozanova, brought it home, and hung it next
					to his other paintings. As he later recounted, he felt as if he had
					lived in a room with closed curtains, and now they had flung open,
					letting in the sunlight. Since that time, George decided to part with
					everything he had collected so far and acquire only avant-garde works.
					This happened in 1946.
