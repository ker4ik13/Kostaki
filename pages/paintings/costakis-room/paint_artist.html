					You have entered the museum, which presents the collection of George
					Dionisovich Costakis. George Dionisovich did not have any special art
					education; he was a self-taught enthusiast endowed with curiosity and
					taste, carrying an unquenchable thirst for beauty in his soul. His
					fascination with art led Costakis to start collecting paintings,
					graphics, icons, becoming a world-renowned collector, the possessor of
					a unique gallery of Russian avant-garde works and Soviet artists from
					the early 20th century.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Costakis was not a conventional patron; he did not possess a fortune
					worth millions. The only source for purchasing artworks was the money
					he earned himself.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					When George collected works of the Russian avant-garde, merely
					mentioning the names of avant-garde artists put individuals at risk of
					repression. Provincial museums forced the writing off and destruction
					of avant-garde works from their storerooms. But Costakis took the
					risk—being the first in the Soviet Union to comprehend the
					significance of Russian avant-gardism in the history of world art,
					seeking and collecting drawings, canvases, and fabrics. He preserved
					much that, left to the whims of fate, would have vanished into
					obscurity.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					George Costakis was born in 1913 in Russia in a large family: he had
					three brothers and a sister. Remaining a Greek subject, he spent most
					of his life in Russia.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					His older brother, Spiridon Costakis, worked as a chauffeur but was
					not just any chauffeur; he was a top-class racer. For several years,
					he won the country's motorcycle championships, which were quite
					popular at the time. Naturally, the brother was an idol for George.
					During those years, the profession of a chauffeur was highly
					prestigious. Many young men from intellectual families, sometimes with
					higher education, proud of their driving skills, held it in high
					regard. Thus, George began working as a driver at the Greek Embassy
					(later—also at the Finnish and Canadian embassies) after school.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					While working as a driver, George often drove the ambassador to
					consignment shops. These visits marked his initial exposure to the
					world of beauty, offering an opportunity to broaden horizons and
					develop a taste. George spent a long time among collectors, listened
					to what they said, observed what they purchased. Gradually, he learned
					to discern and began acquiring porcelain, then mainly Dutch paintings,
					followed by Russian silver, carpets, and fabrics. This continued for
					about ten years.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					But George always pondered that if he continued in the same manner, he
					wouldn't bring anything new to the art world. Everything he collected
					already existed in the Louvre, the Hermitage, perhaps even in every
					major museum in any country and private collections as well.
					Continuing in the same direction, he could become wealthy, but... not
					much more. He yearned to do something extraordinary. Quite
					accidentally, he found himself in a Moscow apartment. There, for the
					first time, he saw two or three canvases by avant-garde artists, one
					of them by Olga Rozanova... And so, he purchased the avant-garde
					paintings, brought them home, and hung them next to the Dutch ones. As
					he later recounted, he felt as if he had lived in a room with closed
					curtains, and now they had flung open, letting in the sunlight. Since
					that time, George decided to part with everything he had collected so
					far and acquire only avant-garde works. This happened in 1946.
