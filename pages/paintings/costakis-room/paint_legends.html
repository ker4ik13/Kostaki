					In the early 20th century, a wave of artistic rebellion surged through
					the hearts and minds of creative souls. This avant-garde movement
					emerged as a response to the stifling conformity of the era, where
					traditional art forms had dominated for centuries. It was a rebellion
					against the strictures of academism and the confines of convention,
					driven by a desire to break free from the artistic shackles that had
					bound artists for generations.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Russian avant-garde art blossomed in the early 20th century amidst the
					turbulent backdrop of the Russian Revolution and a yearning for
					artistic and societal transformation. Visionaries like Wassily
					Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Natalia Goncharova played pivotal
					roles in this movement.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This radical artistic rebellion rejected traditional aesthetics and
					embraced abstraction, geometric shapes, and bold, vibrant colors.
					Malevich's "Black Square," a simple black square on a white canvas,
					became an iconic symbol of this avant-garde movement, signifying a
					break from the past and a blank canvas for the future.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Avant-garde artists sought to create a new visual language, breaking
					free from representational art and emphasizing the emotional and
					intellectual impact of their work. They believed in the idea of the
					"artist-engineer," merging art with science and technology.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Constructivism, another important facet of Russian avant-garde,
					emphasized the functional and industrial aspects of art, merging
					aesthetics with practicality. This approach had a profound impact on
					architecture, graphic design, and even fashion.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Russian avant-garde was more than just art; it was a revolutionary
					cultural force that sought to reshape society. It found expression in
					theater, with radical stage designs and experimental performances, and
					it influenced political propaganda through innovative posters and
					graphics.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					However, as the political climate in Russia shifted, many artists
					faced censorship, and some emigrated to continue their work abroad.
					Despite these challenges, Russian avant-garde art left an indelible
					mark on the global art scene, inspiring generations of artists and
					continuing to influence contemporary art and design to this day.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Here is what George Costakis writes in his autobiography about the
					Russian avant-garde. (Excerpts)
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					From 1908 to 1915, modernism dominated in Russia. Pure avant-garde had
					not yet emerged. Its pioneers were artists like Larionov, Goncharova,
					and Burliuk. Russian cubists and cubo-futurists emerged later. It
					wasn't until after 1915 that the avant-garde movement started, led by
					Malevich. This continued until about 1922; the avant-garde was on the
					rise. Even in the pre-revolutionary period, Russian avant-gardists,
					despite being persecuted, held exhibitions and wrote their manifestos.
					However, the public, for the most part, did not accept or understand
					them and ignored their efforts. After each exhibition, terrible
					articles would appear against these artists; they were criticized,
					called hooligans, and the exhibition organizers were outraged: "Who
					allows this and who needs this?!"
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					During those years, artists not only couldn't sell their paintings but
					no one bought them. Even renowned collectors like Shchukin and
					Morozov, who acquired large quantities of Matisse, Picasso, and
					Bonnard, were not interested in avant-garde artists. Occasionally,
					they would take something figurative by Goncharova or Larionov. So,
					the lives of avant-garde artists were challenging; they received no
					recognition, and until 1917, their situation was dire. However, after
					1917, they received considerable support from the new authorities.
					They saw something revolutionary in this movement, something
					beneficial for the people, and decided to use it for their purposes.
					Artists were allowed, for example, to decorate the Red Square,
					organize celebrations, adorn streets, work on theater decorations,
					etc. There were no restrictions; on the contrary. This continued for
					several years, until 1920.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Gradually, the Tretyakov Gallery and the Russian Museum began to
					purchase works from avant-garde artists. However, the selection leaned
					more towards the more figurative pieces. From around 1922, a decline
					began. The authorities started viewing the avant-garde with caution,
					considering that there was an undertone of, let's say, anarchism among
					these artists. After all, each one was trying to make a statement!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Gradually, the authorities "delicately" started steering the
					avant-garde into the "right path": you are good artists, but you need
					to think that these cubes and squares cannot accomplish anything; you
					must transition to utilitarian art, create something for the people.
					Many listened and began doing that. For example, Lyubov Popova and
					Stepanova, who started making designs for fabrics - Popova wrote that
					she was very pleased when she saw workers at some factory eagerly
					buying fabrics with her designs. The same with Rodchenko; without much
					pressure, in 1929, he stopped pursuing pure art, his geometric
					abstraction, and became engrossed in photography. Tatlin, too—in those
					years, he personally destroyed many of his reliefs. In other words,
					people began losing faith in themselves and started doubting the
					chosen path.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1932, the last exhibition of avant-gardists took place at the
					Historical Museum, featuring works by Malevich, Popova, Klyun, and
					Rodchenko.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Costakis believed that if the authorities' ban had come earlier,
					during the avant-garde's heyday, the artists would have felt that
					something important and necessary was being taken away from them.
					Perhaps each would have found a protector, friend, or acquaintance and
					asked them to hide their paintings, to preserve them. But the artists'
					interest was lost. They willingly accepted it and believed it was how
					it should be.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Russian avant-garde—regarded as "premature births"—appeared 30-40
					years ahead of its time and wasn't understood...
