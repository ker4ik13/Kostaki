					In the early 20th century, a wave of artistic rebellion surged through
					the hearts and minds of creative souls. This avant-garde movement
					emerged as a response to the stifling conformity of the era, where
					traditional art forms had dominated for centuries. It was a rebellion
					against the strictures of academism and the confines of convention,
					driven by a desire to break free from the artistic shackles that had
					bound artists for generations.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Russian avant-garde art blossomed in the early 20th century amidst the
					turbulent backdrop of the Russian Revolution and a yearning for
					artistic and societal transformation. Visionaries like Wassily
					Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Natalia Goncharova played pivotal
					roles in this movement.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This radical artistic rebellion rejected traditional aesthetics and
					embraced abstraction, geometric shapes, and bold, vibrant colors.
					Malevich's "Black Square," a simple black square on a white canvas,
					became an iconic symbol of this avant-garde movement, signifying a
					break from the past and a blank canvas for the future.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Avant-garde artists sought to create a new visual language, breaking
					free from representational art and emphasizing the emotional and
					intellectual impact of their work. They believed in the idea of the
					"artist-engineer," merging art with science and technology.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Constructivism, another important facet of Russian avant-garde,
					emphasized the functional and industrial aspects of art, merging
					aesthetics with practicality. This approach had a profound impact on
					architecture, graphic design, and even fashion.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Russian avant-garde was more than just art; it was a revolutionary
					cultural force that sought to reshape society. It found expression in
					theater, with radical stage designs and experimental performances, and
					it influenced political propaganda through innovative posters and
					graphics.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					However, as the political climate in Russia shifted, many artists
					faced censorship, this art was forbidden, some artists were arrested
					and even executed. Despite these challenges, Russian avant-garde art
					left an indelible mark on the global art scene, inspiring generations
					of artists and continuing to influence contemporary art and design to
					this day.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Here is what George Costakis writes in his autobiography about the
					Russian avant-garde.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					From 1908 to 1915, modernism dominated in Russian Empire.
					Avant-gardeâ€™s pioneers were artists like Mikhail Larionov, Natalia
					Goncharova, and David Burliuk. Avant-garde is not a movement, it is an
					aesthetic period. Within the Russian avant-garde there are many
					movements. After 1915 the avant-garde got into its most experimental
					period with non-objective art, led by Kazimir Malevich and the
					movement of Suprematism. The experimentations in art were on the rise
					until approximately the end of 1920s.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In the pre-revolutionary period, avant-garde artists held exhibitions
					and wrote their manifestos. However, the public often did not accept
					or understand them and ignored their efforts. After each exhibition,
					critical articles would appear against these artists; they were called
					hooligans, and the exhibition organizers were outraged: "Who allows
					this and who needs this?!"
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					During those years, avant-garde artists could not easily sell their
					works. Even renowned collectors like Shchukin and Morozov, who
					acquired large quantities of Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard and other
					artists from the Paris school, were not interested in avant-garde
					artists from Russia. Occasionally, they would take something
					figurative by Goncharova or Larionov. So, the lives of avant-garde
					artists were challenging; they received no recognition, and until
					1917, their situation was dire. However, after 1917, they received
					considerable support from the new authorities. They saw something
					revolutionary in this movement, something beneficial for the people,
					and decided to use it for their purposes. Artists were proposed to
					decorate the Red Square, organize celebrations, adorn streets, work on
					theater set designs and costumes, etc. There were no restrictions; on
					the contrary. This continued for several years, until the very end of
					the 1920s.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Gradually, the Tretyakov Gallery and the Russian Museum began to
					accept works from avant-garde artists. From the end of 1920s a decline
					began. The authorities started viewing the avant-garde with caution,
					considering that there was an undertone of anarchism among these
					artists. After all, each one was trying to make a statement!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In the mid-1920s, constructivism was established in Russian art.
					Artists became engaged in a race, dedicated to an utopian mission to
					change within a few years the whole aesthetic image and perception of
					the society. Liubov Popova and Varvara Stepanova started making
					designs for fabrics - Popova wrote that she was very pleased when she
					saw workers at some factory eagerly buying fabrics with her designs.
					The same with Rodchenko; In 1921 he stopped pursuing pure art, called
					himself a constructivist, worked for art in production and became
					engrossed in photography.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1932 socialist realism appeared as the only accepted aesthetics for
					the arts and very soon all artistic experimentations were forbidden.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Russian avant-garde appeared 30-40 years ahead of its time and
					wasn't understood... It would be a lost chapter in the world art
					history if George Costakis had not realized its great importance and
					started collecting these works of art from the cellars and lofts where
					they were hidden.
