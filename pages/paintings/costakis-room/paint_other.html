					Here is what George Costakis writes in his autobiography about the
					Russian avant-garde.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						Nice to meet you. I'm Georgy Costakis. Our wonderful museum curator
						has already told you something. Including the moment I realized that
						I found dedicating myself to the Russian avant-garde much more
						interesting.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						Gradually, but very actively, I started getting rid of everything I
						had before. I sold some things to the Pushkin Museum, others were
						bought by collectors. Later, I exchanged something for avant-garde
						paintings. I was acting completely blindly because I had no idea
						about the avant-garde. I knew the names Chagall, Kandinsky, heard
						about Malevich, but I didn't know who these artists were or their
						place in the history of painting.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						I searched, and it turned out to be a difficult task. Firstly, the
						avant-garde was prohibited at that time, and those who had it didn't
						publicize it. They hid it and tried not to show it to anyone. And no
						one was interested in buying avant-garde art back then.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i
						>Many friends and relatives pitied me. They believed I made a big
						mistake parting with the old collection, buying, as they unanimously
						considered it, some "nonsense". Among Moscow collectors, I gained an
						unfavorable nickname "the eccentric Greek" who acquires unnecessary
						junk.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i
						>After I managed to acquire a large number of works by Popova, I
						embarked on a new search. I was very interested in Olga Rozanova. It
						was very difficult to come across her trail. Throughout all the
						years of collecting, I managed to get only six or seven of her
						works, including watercolors and gouache. With great difficulty, I
						found and immediately acquired several works by Klun.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>My apartment gradually began to turn into a museum.</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						(Later) ... I managed to buy several works by Tatlin, Lissitzky,
						Rodchenko
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						I must say that if it weren't for me, many avant-garde works would
						have perished. At that time in the Soviet Union, besides me, no one
						needed it. Only after I started collecting and showcasing my
						collection did foreigners begin to look at it. They began to
						specifically come to Moscow to search for paintings and buy them.
						<br />
						Ambassadors, advisors, directors of Western museums, poets, writers
						who visited Moscow willingly visited my collection in my apartment
						on Vernadsky Avenue.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						Once Sir Norman Reid, the director of the Royal Academy at that
						time, came to Moscow and said to me, "If you did for Britain what
						you did for Russia, you would be Sir Costakis." Gradually, the
						secret began to become apparent. People, including official
						authorities... and the KGB, realized that the "eccentric Greek" who
						had been collecting unnecessary "junk" for many years had actually
						collected a valuable collection. There came a moment when living in
						Moscow with such a collection became uncomfortable. We were always
						afraid of robberies, attacks on us and our home. Eventually, it
						happened: I was robbed.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i> I started getting intimidated and blackmailed. </i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						This went on for a long time. We were all exhausted. And I couldn't
						take it anymore; I decided to leave the USSR. But it wasn't easy. I
						proposed to leave a large and best part of my collection as a gift
						to the Tretyakov Gallery and, at the same time, asked to be allowed
						to take a small part for myself.
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<i>
						It became the basis of the museum you've come to. The backbone of
						the Russian avant-garde comprises no less than seventy names. In my
						collection, there are about fifty artists.
