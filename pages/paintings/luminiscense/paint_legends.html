							A student of Malevich and Pevzner in the Moscow free workshops,
							Kudriashov was a leading representative of the pictorial movement
							of “cosmism”.

							His father manufactured aeronautical devices in the bureau of the
							engineer and astrophysicist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Kudriashov
							helped his father with drawings and models and eventually became
							interested in the ideas of intergalactic light-air prophecy
							(cosmism). It can be said that he was the predecessor of the
							contemporary artists James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							One of his key works is the General Scheme of the Decor of the
							Auditorium of the 1st Soviet Theater in Orenburg. This is an
							example of how abstract painting can be combined with real space.
							Standing in front of the painting, the viewer should imagine lying
							on the floor of an old multilevel theater, and then the imaginary
							arches will turn out to be the painted tiers, the floor - a
							suprematist curtain, and the red square in the center - a ceiling
							panel.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							At the end of the 1920s, Kudriashov’s ideas were no longer in
							demand. Gradually since 1932 the artist was expelled from all
							artistic associations for “formalism and persistent
							pointlessness”, but he could not change his principles and
							preferred to be poor, but not a follower of socialist realism.
							During this period, he took on any work, for 2 years he was even a
							prison guard being in charge of a storage room of a prison.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							Kudriashov anticipated Gagarin's flight. Since 1957, he had again
							turned to the space theme. Inspired by news of the cosmonaut dogs
							Belka and Strelka, Kudriashov created a watercolor of a
							Suprematist cosmonaut stretching his arms in interstellar space.
