					As you may have guessed, this painting is related to the theme of
					space. Throughout his entire artistic career, Mikhail Matiushin
					focused on capturing the essence of space in his paintings. The
					foundation of the composition lies in a complex rhythm of swirling and
					rotating masses, symbolizing the substance of space, its unity, and
					its diverse array of colors. Brushstrokes of varying sizes and colors
					create a visual vibration, inducing a shifting effect. Matiushin and
					his students frequently employed this technique when portraying the
					pure essence of aerial or underwater space. The rotational movement of
					the substance correlates with a high musical overtone, akin to
					celestial music where colors harmonize and intersect, generating a
					vibration of sound and color.
