					As you may have guessed, this painting is related to the theme of
					space.Throughout his entire artistic career, Mikhail Matiushin focused
					on capturing the essence of space in his paintings. The foundation of
					the composition lies in a complex rhythm of swirling and rotating
					masses, symbolizing the substance of space, its unity, and its diverse
					array of colors. Brushstrokes of varying sizes and colors create a
					visual vibration, inducing a shifting effect. Matiushin and his
					students frequently employed this technique when portraying the pure
					essence of aerial or underwater space. The rotational movement of the
					substance correlates with a high musical overtone, akin to celestial
					music where colors harmonize and intersect, generating a vibration of
					sound and color.
