							Matiushin was born in the year of the abolition of serfdom (1861),
							but was registered as the son of a serf peasant woman. On his
							father's side, his ancestors were representatives of the
							well-known Saburov acting dynasty.

							Matiushin had perfect pitch. He began learning music independently
							at the age of five. By the age of six, he could pick up and play
							various melodies and songs by ear. At seven, he mastered the
							musical notation. At the age of eight, he began earning by singing
							in the church choir. At nine, he crafted his first violin, and by
							eleven, he became a singing teacher in an orphanage. After his
							first audition, he was admitted to the Nizhny Novgorod
							Conservatory, and later to the Moscow Conservatory, where he
							studied under P.I. Tchaikovsky and Rubinstein. After graduating,
							he was the first violinist of the Court Orchestra in St.
							Petersburg for 30 years.

							As a translator, he traveled to Paris for the World Exhibition.
							French Matiushin also self-taught French – a French governess
							lived in their house.

							After acquainting himself with the theory of the "fourth
							dimension" by the mathematician-theosophist P.D. Uspensky, the
							artist began developing the idea of the so-called "expanded
							vision." He saw it as the only correct way to create modern art,
							considering art as a form of understanding nature. Matiushin had
							no doubt that expanded vision would eliminate "individual
							movement," and ultimately, one person's history would be the
							history of all people.
						</p>
						<br />

							Matiushin regularly conducted spiritualistic sessions, summoning
							the spirit of his deceased wife, the artist and poet Elena Guro.
						</p>

							According to Matiushin's teachings, a landscape should be seen as
							if from several sides at once. His root sculptures were
							essentially the first Russian ready-mades. Extracting real tree
							roots from the ground, Matiushin presented them as art objects.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

							Matiushin headed the Experimental Laboratory of
							Physico-Physiological Foundations of Visual Arts at the State
							Institute of Art History. Together with members of his group
							"Zorved" (Seeing + Knowing), he conducted research on the
							influence of color tones on the observer's perception of form. It
							was found that during prolonged observation, cold tones gave the
							form a "angularity," the color became more star-shaped, while warm
							tones, on the contrary, created a sense of roundness in the form,
							and the color became more circular. In 1932, the "Color Primer"
							was published – a guide to harmonious color combinations.
