					Two different kinds of color-forms under the same title are kept at
					the Costakis collection of MOMus. The two paintings have things in
					common in composition and in painting technique (pointillism). During
					the whole of his creative activity Mikhail Matiushin was concerned
					with the problem of painting space in its essence. Here are two
					pictures where we see what the philosopher Nikolai Fedorov called
					“genesis of the fabric” of space. The composition is based on a
					complex rhythm of twisting, rotating mass. That’s a symbol of the
					space substance, of its unity and color diversity. Brushstrokes of
					different size and color create a visual vibration that leads to the
					effect of shifting. Matiushin and his students often used this method
					while painting the pure substance of aerial or underwater space. The
					substance rotation is related to a high musical overtone. It is a kind
					of celestial music where colors play and interconnect, producing a
					sound/color vibration.
