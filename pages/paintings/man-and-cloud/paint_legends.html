							Nikritin proved himself not only as a painter, but also as a poet
							and innovative stage-director. Within the walls of the Higher
							artistic and technical workshops (abbreviated in Russian as
							VKHUTEMAS) he organized one of the first “abstract” theaters in
							Russia. Projection Theatre, based on the ideas of biomechanics,
							was conceived as a laboratory for interdisciplinary research to
							train a new type of actor.

							Nikritin's lectures were a huge success among students. There is
							evidence of a sold-out audience in a 600-seat auditorium during
							his performance at VKHUTEMAS.

							Solomon Nikritin left behind a theoretical legacy. In 1921, he
							formulated the theory of projectionism. The term "projectus"
							(literally "thrown forward") takes on the meaning of "directed
							into the future." This theory was based on the idea that a new
							culture is, first of all, a new consciousness. Projectionists
							opposed constructivists. They prioritized the creative process,
							which was more important to them than the final result. Their
							ideal projectionist was Leonardo da Vinci.

							Nikritin created a new method of designing exhibitions - based on
							the principle of a screenplay. His main work was a text
							supplemented with photographs and drawings - a total of 26 units,
							but the entire complex has not been preserved. Next to the exhibit
							there was an inscription: “DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE DRAWINGS? SPEND
							2 HOURS ON THEM” and there was a stepladder. This was the first
							example in the history of art of the 20th century of a special
							solution to exhibition as the presentation of an idea. It can be
							said that Nikritin anticipated conceptual art.

							Solomon Nikritin, as an author-designer, worked for the
							International Exhibition in New York in 1939, participated in the
							design of physical education parades on Red Square in Moscow, and
							was involved in the design of Theater Square and the Opera House
							building in Kyiv.

							Nikritin’s work was not without scandals. In 1935, the
							demonstration of his work “Old and New” caused sharp rejection
							among the public and critics, and he almost ended in arrest. One
							of the critics said: “After watching such a work, it’s scary to
							live for a month, despite all the fun of our lives.” The
							“individualistic” and “erotic” tendencies seen in this work were
							associated with the work of the “Italian fascists”. After this
							episode, Nikritin changes his direction and goes underground.
