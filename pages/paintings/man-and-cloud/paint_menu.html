					The tendency towards the representation of what cannot be represented
					realistically, such as, for example, a dream, a vision or a wish, was
					the theme for a series of works of the artists of Russian Avant-garde,
					that expressed human turmoil while confronting the Universe. Such
					works often reflected in different ways the thinking of theosophists
					or the dreamy state of symbolists.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					A celestial challenge of this kind is depicted in Solomon Nikritin's
					painting entitled “Man and Cloud” (1930), in which the cloud hovers
					like a lifeline above a tiny figure standing alone on an islet in the
					middle of nowhere. Amongst the gray, empty and lifeless environment,
					the colored cloud, in which small stories are revealed, expresses
					everything that could be a pleasant memory of life and, moreover,
					every visionary expectation for the upcoming world.
