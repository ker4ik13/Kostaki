					Popova’s brother had a stepson who lived in Zvenigorod, outside
					Moscow. Pavel Sergeievich once suggested me to visit him because he
					assumed that some paintings of his sister might have remained there.
					So I went ... It was a country house with a big garden. It was the
					time then everything was blooming around. Light pink apples, sour
					cherries... I was welcomed very friendly. The first thing I saw on top
					of the stairs was a painting of Popova and on the painting there was a
					craft hanging.

					Later we walked to the garden. I noticed that the window of the
					storage house was nailed with a plywood. On the plywood I could read a
					number and below the signature: «Popova». I entered the storage house
					and I saw the other side of the plywood. It was a great painting! «No,
					I can’t give it to you. If it rains the warehouse will be wet. Bring
					me a plywood and only then I will give you the painting». I had to go
					to Moscow and look for a piece of plywood. I didn’t find the
					dimensions needed so I bought two smaller pieces and brought them to
					Zvenigorod. In return, the landlord gave me the wonderful painting.
