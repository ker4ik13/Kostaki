					Liubov Popova created a series of non-figurative works which she named
					“Painterly Architectonics” during the period 1916-18 and Painterly
					Constructions and Spatial- force constructions during the period
					1920-21. Popova was interested in architecture and studied the
					traditional Russian architecture and also the Islamic architecture of
					Samarkand where she traveled in 1916 and was impressed by its
					combination of colors and geometric forms. Her close friend and
					colleague, the architect Alexander Vesnin, influenced Popova’s
					interest in architectural forms.

				<p>
					In 1916-18 Popova was focused on non-objective painting after
					Malevich's suprematism, although she was not limited – with some
					exceptions concerning some of her first "painterly architectures" - to
					the suprematist formula of space-borne geometrical forms floating on
					an off-white void. For Popova, the concept of Architectonics
					transcends the strict limits of architecture and is related to the
					dynamic combination of geometrical form, volume, color and material.
					Architectonics do not intend to have a structural, functional logic
					but through the power of color and shade they strongly convey a sense
					of plasticity and offer to architecture original proposals of
					harmonious geometry. Moreover, the concept of "plasticity" had
					occupied Popova since her cubofuturistic period, when she described
					her paintings as “plastic”. The Space-Force Constructions, through a
					combination of circular and linear forms create a sense of constant
					motion and seem to transform the painting into an object with kinetic
					energy.
