				<p><strong>George Costakis tells:</strong></p>
				<p>
					At first I managed to get two paintings by Lyubov Popova, then the
					thread broke, and it was only by chance that I got back on the right
					track.

				<p>Popova died in the 24th year, after which I met her brother Pavel</p>
				<p>
					Sergeyevich Popov, a university professor, a very handsome, tall
					gentleman. He lived on the Arbat, in one of the alleys, in a large
					apartment. In the room where he received me, I saw two small paintings
					by Popova.

				<p>
					I said that I had heard a lot about his sister. He says, "Yes, you
					know, she died early, but I still have some of her works." I said that
					I was collecting her works and would like to buy it from him. And he
					replied: "Why not? I'll show you." He led me into another room, where
					10-15 canvases were stacked. All first-class! And I bought them from
					him.

				<p>
					Pavel Sergeevich parted with small canvases with great difficulty.
					When I told him that I would like to buy them too, he did not agree:
					"No, I will leave this one, because it is small, you can always hang
					it, but the big ones... What shall I do with them?"

				<p>
					Pavel Sergeyevich had an adopted son who lived in Zvenigorod. One day
					Pavel Sergeyevich offered to go to him, suggesting that his sister's
					paintings should also remain in Zvenigorod. I went there...

					Country house, large garden. It was just the time of flowering — pink
					and white apple trees, cherries. I was received very well.
				</p>
				<img

				<p>
					And the first thing I saw when I climbed the stairs to the second
					floor was Popova’s painting - there was a trough hanging on it...
				</p>

				<p>
					Then we walked around the garden. And I saw the window of the barn,
					clogged with plywood. The signature could be read on the plywood:
					"Popova".
				</p>

				/>
				<p>
					I went into the barn and saw that on the back of the plywood there was
					a beautiful work by the artist. I immediately offered to sell it to
					me, but the owner of the house replied: "No, I can't, if it rains,
					everything in the barn will get wet. First, bring me the plywood, and
					then I'll give you the painting."
				</p>
				<p>
					I had to go to Moscow to look for plywood. I didn't find the right
					piece, so I bought two smaller ones and brought them to Zvenigorod.

					Help Costakis get a painting by Lyubov Popova into his collection!

					In exchange, the owner gave me a beautiful painting. He also sold the
					rest of the paintings to me very cheaply.

					Thus, I acquired most of Popova's works from the family of the late
