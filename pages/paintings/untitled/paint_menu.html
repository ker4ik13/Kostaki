					The organic direction in art, which was introduced by Mikhail
					Matiushin, arose from the inspiration instilled in him by his
					early-departed wife, the poet, author and painter Elena Guro.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Guro, who died at just 36 years of age, leaving behind a significant
					body of paintings and writings, sees nature in contrast to the urban
					environment, not in the sense of two opposing conditions of the human
					experience, but as a transition from a space of secondary daily
					conventions (city), to a space of primary and experimental pursuit of
					the perception of life, of Beauty (nature).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This pursuit started out from the view that had been cultivated by
					symbolists, that the profound and substantial pursuit of Beauty lies
					in nature and the universe. However, she went beyond symbolism, the
					physical environment becoming for her a field for research and
					experimentation. She methodically engaged herself in synthesising the
					arts and spoke of “synaesthesia” in arts.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					After her death, when speaking about Guro, Matiushin prophetically
					stated that the transcendence of earthly life will soon be achieved,
					that the three dimensions will be exceeded and that ‘things will rise
					again in a wonderful new world’.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Guro tried to represent the organic movement of nature, thus leaving
					us with some of the first sketches of pure abstraction in the history
					of art.
