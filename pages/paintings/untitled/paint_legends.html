							Elena Guro was born in a family of French aristocrats. Her family
							came from among the Huguenots, French Protestants. Her paternal
							grandfather, Marquis de Mericourt, emigrated from France to Russia
							after the 1793 revolution.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>

						<p>
							Elena Guro was married to another famous representative of the
							Russian avant-garde, artist Matiushin. They met in an art
							workshop, where Guro learned the basics of painting.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Guro developed new theories of color in painting. An interest in
							exploring the rules of color was central to her work. Guro drew
							inspiration from Art Nouveau and Scandinavian folk art.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Guro was not only an artist, but also a poetess. Her poetry was
							born from painting, and painting embodied poetry. Guro's work was
							the synthesis of words and drawings. While working on the word,
							she immediately made sketches. When she made a drawing or
							watercolor, she wrote poetry or prose on the edge.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							All her books are dedicated to the memory of her deceased son,
							although she never had children. For Elena Guro the
							personification of the image of this unborn son, the image that
							she created in her imagination, was the artist Boris Ender, a
							student of Matiushin. This is what he wrote: “I went to Guro to be
							born as a poet. It was as if it was not I who came to her, but she
							appeared to me with good news like an archangel.”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Critics did not take Guro's poetry very favorably. Deciding that
							these deep touches of the subtlest sensual sphere were unlikely to
							be able to reach a person ignorant of suffering, Guro distributed
							her works in prisons and hospitals. Thus, she made a breakthrough
							of her poetry into life.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The modest wooden house in which Guro lived with Matiushin in St.
							Petersburg is now the Avant-garde Museum.
