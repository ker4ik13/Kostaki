					George Costakis describes in his memoirs how he found for his famous
					collection works by Elena Guro and Mikhail Matiushin:
				</p>
				<p>
					I had to make special research in Leningrad too, in order to find some
					specific works… There I obtained a big collection of works by the
					Ender brothers, this incredible team of artists, which was named
					ZORVED (See – Know) and was led by Mikhail Matiushin. Matiushin’s
					wife, Elena Guro, was brilliant. She blew life into Matiushin, but she
					died in 1913. Her ideas were marvelous, and she is said to have
					painted abstractions as early as 1908.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The ZORVED team was very active during the years 1922-1925. I bought a
					huge amount of their works but many of them were later on stolen. I
					manage to save some 250 paintings and drawings.

					The organic direction in art, which was introduced by Mikhail
					Matiushin, arose from the inspiration instilled in him by his
					early-departed wife, the poet, author and painter Elena Guro. Guro,
					who died at just 36 years of age, leaving behind a significant body of
					paintings and writings, sees nature in contrast to the urban
					environment, not in the sense of two opposing conditions of the human
					experience, but as a transition from a space of secondary daily
					conventions (city), to a space of primary and experimental pursuit of
					the perception of life, of Beauty (nature). This pursuit started out
					from the view that had been cultivated by symbolists, that the
					profound and substantial pursuit of Beauty lies in nature and the
					universe. However, she went beyond symbolism, the physical environment
					becoming for her a field for research and experimentation. She
					methodically engaged herself in synthesising the arts and spoke of
					“synaisthesia” in arts. After her death, when speaking about Guro,
					Matiushin prophetically stated that the transcendence of earthly life
					will soon be achieved, that the three dimensions will be exceeded and
					that ‘things will rise again in a wonderful new world’. Guro tried to
					represent the organic movement of nature, thus leaving us with some of
					the first sketches of pure abstraction in the history of art.
