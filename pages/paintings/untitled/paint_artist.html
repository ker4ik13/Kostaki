					George Costakis describes in his memoirs how he found for his famous
					collection works by Elena Guro and Mikhail Matiushin:
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I had to make special research in Leningrad too, in order to find some
					specific works… There I obtained a big collection of works by the
					Ender brothers, this incredible team of artists, which was named
					ZORVED (See – Know) and was led by Mikhail Matiushin. Matiushin’s
					wife, Elena Guro, was brilliant. She blew life into Matiushin, but she
					died in 1913. Her ideas were marvelous, and she is said to have
					painted abstractions as early as 1908.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The ZORVED team was very active during the years 1922-1925. I bought a
					huge amount of their works but many of them were later on stolen. I
					manage to save some 250 paintings and drawings.
