							According to the memoirs of sculptor Vera Mukhina, Lyubov Popova
							“was tall, well-built, had wonderful eyes and luxuriant hair.”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Popova's father was the owner of cloth factories, a textile
							merchant and philanthropist. This circumstance undoubtedly helped
							Popova when developing textile design. Popova said: “I have never
							experienced such satisfaction as when I saw a village woman buying
							a piece of my fabric for her dress.”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In 1912, Popova went to Paris to study Cubism. The artist Nadezhda
							Udaltsova, who went with her, recalled how they were looking for a
							workshop: “Popova and I examined everything possible, and began to
							look for a workshop. We intended to work for Matisse, but
							Matisse's school was already closed. We went to the workshop of
							Maurice Denis, came across a sitting Indian with feathers on a red
							background, we ran away. Someone mentioned Le Fauconnier’s La
							Palette workshop, we went there and immediately decided that this
							was what we needed.”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							As a theater artist, Lyubov Popova worked with director Vsevolod
							Meyerhold on the plays “The Magnificent Cuckold” and “The Earth in
							Turmoil.” Sharing Meyerhold's views on the work of an actor as a
							purely production activity, Popova created sketches of the actor's
							special production clothing (overalls), convenient for rehearsals
							and for many different roles and providing maximum opportunities
							for a variety of movements and actions.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Popova taught at the State Higher Theater Workshops. Among her
							students was the creator of the film “Battleship Potemkin,” film
							director Sergei Eisenstein.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the last years of her life, Popova completely abandoned easel
							painting. Her creativity was completely aimed at art in
							production. She became one of the first Soviet designers, as one
							famous art critic put it, “breaking a hole in the Chinese wall
							that existed between industry and art.”
