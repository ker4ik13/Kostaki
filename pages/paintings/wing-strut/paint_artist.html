					Vladimir Evgrafovich Tatlin (Moscow, December 16th, 1885; Moscow, May
					31st, 1953) attended the Institute of Painting, Sculpture and
					Architecture in Moscow (1902-1903) and studied at the School of Fine
					Arts in Penza (1905-1910). From 1911 till 1914 he exhibited at various
					exhibitions (Izdebsky Salons, Odessa, 1910-1911; “Union of Youth’s”
					exhibitions, St. Petersburg, 1911-1914; Donkey’s Tail, Moscow, 1912;
					Jack of Diamonds, Moscow, St.Petersburg, 1913; Contemporary Painting,
					Moscow, 1912-1913, 1914). In 1911 he organized a studio in Moscow
					called “The Tower” and designed the stage set for The Emperor
					Maximilian and his Disobedient Son Adolph by M.M. Tomashevsky;
					however, the scenery painters executed the designs so carelessly that
					Tatlin denied authorship. In 1912-1913 he worked on a series of
					sketches for the scenery and the costumes of Mikhail Glinka’s opera A
					life for the Tsar and in 1915-1918 for Richard Wagner’s opera The
					Flying Dutchman. In 1914 he traveled to Berlin and then to Paris,
					where he visited Picasso’s studio, and probably saw Picasso’s cubist
					constructions. He returned back to Russia and started working on his
					own counter-reliefs. On the 10th of May 1914, in his studio in Moscow,
					he held an exhibition of his first reliefs and counter-reliefs,
					“synthetic-static compositions”. He lived in Moscow, but spent long
					periods in Petrograd, where a circle of young artists was formed
					around him. In 1915 he participated in all the major avant-garde
					shows, including First Futurist Exhibition of Paintings: Tramway V and
					The Last Futurist Exhibition of Pictures: 0.10 in Petrograd and in the
					Painting Exhibition. The Year 1915 in Moscow. In 1916 he organized The
					Store exhibition in Moscow. In 1918 he collaborated with The Visual
					Arts Department of the People’s Commissariat for Enlightenment (IZO
					NARKOMPROS). He moved to Petrograd in 1919 and worked as an instructor
					at the Free State Art Studios (SVOMAS) in Petrograd. His workshop
					there was called Studio for Volumes, Materials and Constructions. At
					the same time he started working on the Monument for the Third
					International. In November 1920 the model was shown in Petrograd and
					then in Moscow. In 1923 he participated in the Exhibition of Paintings
					of Petrograd Artists of All Trends, he took an active part in the
					Institute of Artistic Culture (Inkhuk) and organized the production of
					Velimir Khlebnikov’s Zangezi. In the mid-1920s he started showing
					interest in applied art. In 1925 he took part in the Exposition
					Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.
					From 1925 to 1927 he taught formal disciplines in the theatre and
					cinema department of the Art Institute in Kiev and from 1927 to 1930
					he taught “culture of materials” in the Department of wood and
					metalwork at the Faculty of ceramics at the Higher State Art-Technical
					Studios (VKHUTEIN). From 1929 onwards he started working upon a flying
					machine, called Letatlin. In the 1930s-1940s he continued working as a
					stage designer and returned to figurative painting.
