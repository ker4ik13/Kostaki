					Vladimir Evgrafovich Tatlin (Moscow, December 16th, 1885; Moscow, May
					31st, 1953) attended the Institute of Painting, Sculpture and
					Architecture in Moscow (1902-1903) and studied at the School of Fine
					Arts in Penza (1905-1910).

				<p>
					From 1911 till 1914 he exhibited at various exhibitions (Izdebsky
					Salons, Odessa, 1910-1911; “Union of Youth’s” exhibitions, St.
					Petersburg, 1911-1914; Donkey’s Tail, Moscow, 1912; Jack of Diamonds,

					In 1911 he organized a studio in Moscow called “The Tower” and
					designed the stage set for the theater play «The Emperor Maximilian
					and his Disobedient Son Adolph» by M.M. Tomashevsky; however, the
					scenery painters executed the designs so carelessly that Tatlin denied
					authorship. In 1912-1913 he worked on a series of sketches for the
					scenery and the costumes of Mikhail Glinka’s opera «A life for the
					Tsar» and in 1915-1918 for Richard Wagner’s opera «The Flying
					Dutchman».

					In 1914 he traveled to Berlin and then to Paris, where he visited
					Picasso’s studio, and probably saw Picasso’s cubist constructions. He
					returned back to Russia and started working on his own
					“counter-reliefs”.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					On the 10th of May 1914, in his studio in Moscow, he held an
					exhibition of his first painterly and corner counter-reliefs. He lived
					in Moscow, but spent long periods in Petrograd, where a circle of
					young artists was formed around him.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1915 he participated in all the major avant-garde shows, including
					First Futurist Exhibition of Paintings: Tramway V and The Last
					Futurist Exhibition of Pictures: 0.10 in Petrograd.
				</p>
				<p>In 1916 he organized The Store exhibition in Moscow.</p>
				<p>
					In 1918 he collaborated with The Visual Arts Department of the
					People’s Commissariat for Enlightenment (IZO NARKOMPROS).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					He moved to Petrograd in 1919 and worked as an instructor at the Free
					State Art Studios (SVOMAS) in Petrograd. His workshop there was called
					Studio for Volume, Material and Construction. At the same time he
					started working on the Monument for the Third International known also
					as the “Tatlin Tower”. In November 1920 the model was shown in
					Petrograd and then in Moscow.
				</p>
				<br />

					In 1923 he participated in the Exhibition of Paintings of Petrograd
					Artists of All Trends, he took an active part in the Institute of
					Artistic Culture (Inkhuk) and organized the production of Velimir
					Khlebnikov’s poetry book “Zangezi”.
				</p>
				<p>In the mid-1920s he started showing interest in applied arts.</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In 1925 he took part in the Exposition Internationale des Arts
					Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.
				</p>
				<br />

					cinema department of the Art Institute in Kiev and from 1927 to 1930
					he taught “culture of materials” in the Department of wood and
					metalwork at the Faculty of ceramics at the Higher State Art-Technical
					Studios (VKHUTEIN).

					Letatlin. In the 1930s-1940s he continued working as a stage designer
					and returned to figurative painting.
