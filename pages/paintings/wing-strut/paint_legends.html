							Tatlin's life was closely connected with navigation. As a
							teenager, he ran away from home and, working as a cabin boy,
							sailed on a steamship, making a voyage along the route
							Odessa-Varna-Istanbul-Rize-Batumi and back. Later, Tatlin entered
							the Odessa School of Merchant Shipping and spent a whole year
							sailing as a "sailor apprentice" on a sailing ship. After
							completing art school, he continued working as a sailor, traveling
							to cities along the Black and Mediterranean Seas.
						</p>

							Tatlin had a musical talent. He learned to play the guitar and
							accordion, but his favorite instrument was the bandura, a stringed
							folk instrument of wandering musicians in Eastern Ukraine. Tatlin
							made his own banduras. In 1913, he was offered to go to Berlin to
							participate in the Russian handicraft exhibition as a "blind"
							singer-bandurist. According to his recollections, the exhibition
							was successful, and visitors touched his shirt, shook his hand,
							and thanked him. Tatlin also claimed to have played the bandura
							for Kaiser Wilhelm II.

							Tatlin went to Paris to meet Picasso, a dream he had after seeing
							Picasso's reliefs in the French magazine "Soirées de Paris." They
							were introduced by Lithuanian sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, a friend
							of Tatlin. The meeting lasted for several hours, during which the
							artists had a lively conversation. Afterward, Picasso gave Tatlin
							several tubes of paint, and they bid each other farewell warmly.
						</p>

							The trip to Europe convinced Tatlin to abandon painting completely
							and never pick up a brush again. Tatlin began to create "material
							selections" and "pictorial reliefs," which, in their radicalism,
							surpassed even Malevich's non-objective compositions. Later, he
							transformed his concept radically, adding materials such as metal,
							fabric, and pieces of wood to his reliefs, renaming them
							"counter-reliefs," thus demonstrating that art could be anything,
							well before Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain."
						</p>
						<br />

						<p>
							"Letatlin," a flying apparatus powered by human muscle force, is
							one of Tatlin's major works. While working on its creation, he
							studied the anatomy of birds. There are memories from
							contemporaries about birds being present in the artist's dwelling.
							German artist Georg Grosz recalled visiting Tatlin: "I visited
							Tatlin again, this lanky jester. He lived in a tiny, old,
							dilapidated apartment. Chickens he kept slept on his bed. In one
							corner, they laid eggs." A neighbor of Tatlin in Kyiv remembered
							that the artist "lived with a stork and raised frogs."
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							After several trials of "Letatlin," a meeting was held with
							aviation specialists. The engineers claimed that the flying
							apparatus had "too small a useful coefficient." Tatlin retorted,
							"Try talking to a crow; maybe it will listen to you and, because
							of the 'small coefficient,' stop flying and start walking."
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							One of the students in the free workshops recalled how Tatlin
							encouraged his students during classes when there was a shortage
							of food and firewood for heating in Moscow: "On certain days of
							the month, Vladimir Yevgrafovich entered the workshop, holding a
							piece of black bread under his arm... took a knife from his boot
							and cut us a large slice of bread, sometimes giving us an onion,
							saying at the same time, 'Your work is hard and serious, so you
							need support.'
