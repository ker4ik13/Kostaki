					Over the years 1929-1932 Vladimir Tatlin was engaged in realizing one
					of his most bold and bizarrely utopian designs: the construction of a
					flying machine, a winged bicycle which he christened Letatlin (a
					compound made up of the artist’s own name and the Russian verb letat’
					– to fly). From the moment of its conception the Letatlin was seen as
					a machine to be driven solely by human power. Tatlin’s flying bicycle
					was intended to liberate mankind from the bonds of gravity and offer
					him the sensation of flight enjoyed by the birds. In constructing this
					machine Tatlin laid greater emphasis on organic design than on
					technology, using materials such as wood, cork, silk, leather, steel
					threads etc. Progress in the field of aviation, various studies on the
					laws of flight, his own research into the “culture of materials” and a
					profound study of natural forms and structures – these constituted the
					foundations of Tatlin’s work on the project. In 1923 he presented
					three models of the Letatlin in Moscow. But for all his efforts, the
					Letatlin never flew. The wing strut in the Costakis Collection is the
					only component of these three models to have survived.
