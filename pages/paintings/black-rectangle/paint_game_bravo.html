					When the painting Black Quadrilateral was analyzed by art conservation
					specialist Maria Kokkori, the x-ray revealed traces of an earlier
					painting below it.

					It was part of a lost painting, one of the sketches for which is known
					with the title War (1914) and depicts a horse with the words “Berlin”,
					“War”, “Teeth”, “Fallacy”, “Painting” and “Simulation" (Khardzhiev
					collection, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam).

					According to Kokkori, there was almost no dust to be found between the
					two colored layers, which means that Malevich painted this certain
					suprematist work right after he had completed the earlier painting,
					making the Black Quadrilateral one of the earliest works of
					suprematist painting and leading us safely to date it from 1915.
