							Malevich, the creator of mysterious paintings and equally
							incomprehensible texts, was a convenient object for
							mythologization. He himself was not averse to participating in
							decorating his biography with spectacular fables.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Once passing by an art school, Malevich heard a whisper among the
							applicants who were about to take the entrance exams: “Malevich,
							Malevich is coming.” “And they tried to touch me secretly in order
							to pass the exam. They lightly touch me from behind, and I walked,
							not showing that I notice,” he later said, “I didn’t want to scare
							away their faith!”
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Malevich had many enemies who never missed an opportunity to
							settle scores with him. Thus, the poet and avant-garde artist Igor
							Terentyev reported that Malevich’s non-objective painting “was a
							way of encrypted transmission abroad of information about the
							Soviet Union.” According to him, all these squares, architectons,
							etc. were actually plans for Soviet secret objects.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Malevich and artist Vladimir Tatlin had contrasting views on art.
							While Malevich advocated rejecting utilitarianism and reaching for
							the cosmos, Tatlin championed materialism and craftsmanship. In
							1916 Tatlin organized the "Magazin" ("Shop") exhibition in Moscow,
							banning the display of Suprematist works. In response, Malevich
							turned himself into an exhibit, donning the numbers "0.1" on his
							forehead and a poster declaring his role: "I am the Apostle of
							groundbreaking art concepts, and as the SURGEON OF THE MIND
							reigning on the throne of creative pride, I proclaim the ACADEMY
							to be a stable for philistines." Tatlin responded by knocking the
							chair out from under Malevich and inviting him to sit on geometry
							and color.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The faceted glass, popular in the Soviet Union and later in the
							world, was born thanks to Malevich. The artist was sent to prison
							on charges of anti-Soviet propaganda. There he noticed
							uncomfortable glasses made of thin glass, which burst when
							squeezed in his hand. After being released from prison, he
							suggested that the sculptor Vera Mukhina “improve” the shape of
							the glass by adding edges to it. The idea turned out to be so
							successful that faceted glasses were put into mass production.
						</p>
						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Greenish doctor's coats and orange vests of road workers are also
							Malevich's design. In his theoretical works, he proved that white
							color increases pain, and orange color attracts attention more
							than others and signals danger.
